This code implements a simple command-line version of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors." The game consists of three main functions: get_user_choice, get_computer_choice, and determine_winner. The get_user_choice function prompts the user to enter their choice of "rock," "paper," or "scissors," validating the input to ensure it's one of the three valid options. The get_computer_choice function randomly selects one of these options for the computer using the random.choice function. The determine_winner function compares the user's choice with the computer's choice to determine the outcome, applying the standard rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. The main function orchestrates the game, allowing the user to play multiple rounds, keeping track of the scores for both the user and the computer. After each round, the user is asked if they want to play again. If they choose not to, the final scores are displayed, and the game ends.
