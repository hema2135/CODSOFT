This code defines a basic calculator that can perform four arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The functions `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide` each take two arguments and return the result of the respective operation. The program begins by displaying a menu of options to the user, asking them to select an operation. It then enters a loop where the user can input their choice and two numbers. The program checks if the user's choice corresponds to one of the four operations, and if valid, performs the selected operation and displays the result. The program also includes error handling to ensure that the user inputs valid numbers. After each calculation, the user is prompted to decide whether to perform another calculation or exit the program. If the user chooses to stop, the loop breaks, and the program ends.
