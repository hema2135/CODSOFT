This code implements a simple task management application in Python. It starts by defining several functions: display_menu shows the user the available options; add_task allows the user to input a new task and adds it to a list; view_tasks displays the current tasks with their respective indices; and mark_task_done removes a task from the list after the user indicates it has been completed. The save_tasks function writes the list of tasks to a file called tasks.txt, ensuring that tasks persist between sessions, while load_tasks reads tasks from this file when the program starts. The main program loop in the main function repeatedly displays the menu, takes user input to execute the corresponding function, and exits when the user chooses to, saving the tasks before exiting. The code is designed to be run as a standalone script, starting the main function if executed directly.
